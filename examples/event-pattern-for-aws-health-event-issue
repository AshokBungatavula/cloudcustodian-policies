If you want this rule to get triggered for all AWS services, 
you will not be able to use "detail" such as "eventTypeCategory" [1]. 
Therefore, the pattern to monitor all AWS Health events is:


{
  "source": [
    "aws.health"
  ],
  "detail-type": [
    "AWS Health Event"
  ]
}

If you want this to get triggered for a specific service (e.g. ELB), you can change it to the following:


{
  "source": [
    "aws.health"
  ],
  "detail-type": [
    "AWS Health Event"
  ],
  "detail": {
    "service": [
      "ELASTICLOADBALANCING"
    ],
    "eventTypeCategory": [
      "issue"
    ]
  }
}
